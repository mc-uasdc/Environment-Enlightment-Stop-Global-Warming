        <marquee>Help stop GLOBAL WARMING!</marquee>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <a>Global Warming is a fever of the Earth's climate. It's a big feature and was shown by various measurements by the warming. Temperatures get hotter and people still trigger Global Warming.</a>
        <p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
        <a>Why is it important, you may ask? Well, it's important because Global Warming can cause sea level rise, and loss of food and shelter. If these impacts happen, how can you eat if there's no more food left? Where can you find another shelter and live there? In another planet? Besides, we can breathe air and not underwater, and we can drown underwater.</a>
        <p><strong>Actions to stop Global Warming</strong></p>
        <a>Don't know what to do to not make Global Warming worse? It's okay. It's not the end of the world just yet! We can help you by explaining you a few actions that you should do, so don't worry!</a>
        <p>-You can ride in a vehicle, but not in cars. You can either just walk or ride on a bike. Sure, they're slower, but they give you energy and carbon dioxide unlike cars.</p>
        <p>-Turn off all electronic devices if you aren't using them, like computers, TVs, phones, VCRs, etc. Leaving them on can waste energy. Turning devices off takes only less than a couple seconds.</p>
        <p>-Recycle more often. It's never a good thing to litter garbage on the ground, especially on Earth Day. Littering can harm the planet and can also cause global warming, so try to recycle more often and think twice before littering.</p>
        <p><strong>To top it all off</strong></p>
        <a>In conclusion, Temperatures rise over time and time because everyone kept on triggering Global Warming. Global Warming can cause sea level rise, and loss of shelter and food. To prevent global warming, don't drive in cars, but try turning off all devices when not in use, and try to recycle more often.</a>
